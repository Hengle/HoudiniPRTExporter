This file contains instructions to build HoudiniPRTExporter from source. 
****************************************************************************

Prerequisites:
	1. Ensure Houdini 12 or Houdini 13 is installed.
	2. Ensure that the PRT I/O reference library headers are copied locally. https://github.com/ThinkboxSoftware/PRT-IO-Library
	3. You might need to install OpenEXR libraries and headers. http://www.openexr.com/
	4. You might need to install Zlib libraries and headers. http://www.zlib.net/

Build Instructions:
	1. Create a local copy of this repository.
	2. Modify build.bat (Windows), build_linux.sh (Linux) or build_osx.sh (OS X) to point to the prerequisite libraries. Normally, OpenEXR and Zlib libraries are included in your Houdini Installation Folder.
	3. Launch the "Houdini Command Line Tools". Alternatively, on Linux and on OS X, you can open a Command Line Terminal and call "source houdini_setup" from /Library/Frameworks/Houdini.framework/Versions/{Your Houdini Version}/Resources on OS X or from {Your Houdini Installation Folder} on Linux.
	5. Run build.bat, build_linux.sh or build_osx.sh from the "Houdini Command Line Tools" or from the Command Line Terminal where Houdini's environment has been initialized.
